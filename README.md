# Simple-Python-Parser
Hi this is a really simple python parser made using the ANTLR4 framework. To run this repository you'll need the latest antlr4 jar also well as the python runtime tools associated with that jar.
To generate your parser and lexer for your grammer you can run antlr4 Dlanguage=Python3 PythonGrammar.g4 the grammar file will be included in the repository.
After that you should be able to run the python script antlr_project.py and it will print out the correspoding parsed grammar
